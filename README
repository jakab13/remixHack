Remix Hack
using Python, SoundCloud API and EchoNest Remix API

The output of this hack is a new song which is a re-synthesis of an original one with a generated one. The basis of this song is given by the first song found on SoundCloud given by the artist name in the search (in this case “robclouth”). After downloading this particular song, an array is filled up with the name/id of the followers of the original artist. Then from each of the followers' account a song is picked from which a 1 second long slice is chosen. These one second long slices are concatenated into one sound file. This sound file is then used as the basis of the re-synthesis of the original first song of the given artist.On a more meaningful level, this hack can be thought of a some sort experiment of an online social study of music, where one music producer can hear how his/her audience can relate to him/her in terms of music. It points out an approach in which the player itself is comprised of the bits of his/her own audience.
